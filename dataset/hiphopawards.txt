WHY SOME PEOPLE STAY BROKE

1. Full of Doubt

2. Fear of other failed businesses

3. Comfortable with being broke

4. Keep looking for proof / results

5. Always scared to take risk and always thinking negatively.

TAKE THAT BOLD STEP TODAY

<|endoftext|>

@Thandiwear @IAmNxthi @BET_Africa I need to listen to him too #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@__Neesha_ If this is high key dependant on numbers you might be right 🧐 #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@notriky_ @BET_Africa They can’t keep on sleeping on such talent though 💔 #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa Drake. He has been consistent. A personal fave #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa Stuck between Mustard &amp;&amp; DJ Khalad #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa Da Baby might steal it but everyone loves Cardi's Money 💀 #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa I'll look out for him. 👌 #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa Mustard really ? Bruh Khaled definitely taking it #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa Nipsey hustle #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa I'm with you on Drake taking lyricist of the year 💯 @BET_Africa #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa Yet again Travis and Drake deserve the award😭 everything from sicko mode was great 🙌🏾 #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@NoNo_Belle_ @BET_Africa @RemoTsomakae Say the right thing .... #HipHopAwards https://t.co/YdnZU7WwAC

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa We try again next time with a better project 👏 #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa I’m still not sure if I should set my alarm for 2AM or just watch at 7pm🤔 #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa I hear you but let's not forget A Lot you know that track did the most since it dropped #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa Tricky one #HipHopAwards 😭😭😭

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa Drama, Mustard and Khaled😭😭😭. I cant decide #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa Dj Khaaaaled #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa Meg the Stallion can take this one home 👏🏽 #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa Here we fight nothing comes close to Sicko Mode Visually it's not even a discussion #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa I agree with you 👌 #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa Made up my mind, I'm going with MONEY by @iamcardib #HipHopAwards 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa I really think it should be Drake hey 🤔 #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa My money is on FEVER!!!!! #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

Drake got murked by Push and you think he deserves Lyricist of the year 😂 I like Drake but Jermaine Lamarr Cole is the best Lyricist on the list #HipHopAwards https://t.co/cUBizQndAi

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa For me it’s between Dababy and Meg The Stallion 🙆🏾‍♀️ #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

No way I'm putting Drake above Cole. Drake shouldn't even be nominated COLE WENT PLATINUM WITHOUT A FEATURE if that doesn't mean he is MVP I don't know #HipHopAwards https://t.co/qKJgw6lobJ

<|endoftext|>

@BET_Africa Megan literally came out of nowhere and made things shake #HipHopAwards

I'll be happy if Sarkod brings that award to Africa #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@NoNo_Belle_ Drake good at making hits but didn't deliver lyrically in the past year #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa Definitely Aubrey #HipHopAwards . He's being the most since day one 😭. Since "room for improvement" mixtape .

<|endoftext|>

Drake's best line in the past year is "She said  do you  love me I told her only partly I only love Mahbed and my Momma I'm sorry"  #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@Sako_Ndlebe @BET_Africa One of the many reasons why I hope she takes it @BET_Africa #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa Can't wait 😭😭 #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@lenthengM_ @IAmNxthi @BET_Africa Both #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa Mine too #HipHopAwards .

<|endoftext|>

@NoNo_Belle_ @IAmNxthi @BET_Africa My fave is Mustard😭 #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@Pukii__ @IAmNxthi @BET_Africa Cardi has gotten us through a lot this year. She is going to win #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

@IAmNxthi @BET_Africa I feel like jcole and 21 Savage should take this one.

BUT..

My heart would be at ease if Drake and Travis takes it  #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

Lemme check this hashtag --&gt; #HipHopAwards

Not every girl wants to get married by 23. So before you ASSUME she's of marriageable age, ask her what her views on marriage are. One hint, might save you the drama- just because she does not want to get married now does not mean she never will. #HipHopAwards #sexForGrades

<|endoftext|>

These background tracks 🙄. The voice over is so loud on these “performances” that you’re just watching someone dance around and occasionally join in with the pre-recorded vocals. It’s like dancing along to the freaking radio and going “yeeeaaah” a few times. #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

Omg these dance moves Saweetie , wth Lol but she cute though lol  #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

I'm bored and not impressed 😒😩I have so many questions and it's only 37 mins into the show #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

Petey Pablo for the 90’s babies ayyyyeeeeeeeeee  #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>

@KeyGLOCK Damn Daddy you look good 😍😍  #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

When educators don't bring their whole selves to the classroom it reminds me of lipsyncing. Yes, you are physically present but your spirit and willingness to connect with affect is not. Can't posture pedagogy. #HipHopEd
#HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

I think I'm the only one not watching the #HipHopAwards huh??

<|endoftext|>

Ready for the next cypher  #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

So you can 'curse' on ANY other award show and channel, but not at a #HipHopAwards show on BET?  This is a "pre-recorded" mess.

<|endoftext|>

Lil Duval is a Lit Host 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 #HipHopAwards #BETHipHopAwards2019 #BETHipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

Seeing as though a non battle rap crowd is judging the battles DNA is going to win. He’s going to continue to freestyle and name drop for crowd reactions. No shade tho thats my nigga 💯 #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

Wtf is up with these ppl competing for this 25k? They should’ve wrote something before they came in and if this “freestyle” is that, I need whoever giving out the money to politely put it back in they pocket cause these niggas trash. #hiphopawards

<|endoftext|>

Ewww Chile these guys need to go back in the lab  #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

The only good thing about this show so far are the memes and comments from Black twitter 💯💯💯💯 #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

Ohh rap battle that I shotguns lol  ya shooting tho... 
 #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

69 is everybody punch line.. how authentic ? #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

BET needs to stop playing around and cancel #HipHopAwards for real.

<|endoftext|>

1.5 hours into the show &amp; only three awards were presented #HipHopAwards https://t.co/vR3bc5ymX5

<|endoftext|>

#HipHopAwards No wonder there's few mainstream rappers with hard bars. These rap battles without beats stifle natural progression which is supposed to lead to the studio next.

<|endoftext|>

@GlamIsWhoIAm08 Yessss.... whole reason I'm watching.  #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

Sooooo are we just gonna ignore the fact that Lil Cease snitched on Kim?   Askin for da culture.  #HipHopAwards

<|endoftext|>

I def feel like Rapsody these days. It’s like you struggle to try to blend in when you in a whole different class than your peers, and they whisper and marvel at you cause they don’t want no smoke  #HipHopAwards

It was your power they were scared of. They saw your passion influence the masses and shift the consciousness 💥 You were melanated, educated, elevated and they feared that.

The only White Supremacy I’ve ever seen is from White Liberals. They sit in their gentrified neighborhoods dictating to People of Color who to vote for, what to believe in, what to be offended by, etc. If one decides not to follow their sh*t? Their racism comes out.

I think the appropriate question should be; what am I doing to get off a dull looking skin?
.
If wishes were horses, beggars would ride on it!!!!

You can't just sit back and wish for a healthy skin! No baby, it doesn't work that way

For decades, the world has been run by a corrupt political system.
The mainstream media has kept you in the dark about it.

"Hip Hop" is very anti-black. VERY. I  don't understand how people don't see that. Most of it is colorist. Promotes unsafe sex practices. Anti black women. Anti women in general. It used to be good. But that was 30 years ago.

The had that manchild lil duvay or whatever the fuck up there who consistently makes negative tweets about black women.
