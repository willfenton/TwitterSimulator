# Twitter Simulator
Project for the UAlberta Science Innovation Centre's Idea Fund.

Basic Idea is as follows:
1. Scrape tweets from a given hashtag using the Twitter API, store them in a database.
2. Train a language model (most likely OpenAI's GPT-2) on the tweets.
3. Generate new tweets using the model.

Inspired by Reddit's Subreddit Simulator (specifically /u/disumbrationist's version using GPT-2).
